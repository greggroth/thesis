% Temperature imaging cameras.

From the Beer-Lambert law~\cref{eq:beerlambert}, the penetration depth, $\delta_{p}$ can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \frac{1}{\alpha} \label{eq:penetrationdepth}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient.  At body temperature (37\degree) the peak wavelength in the blackbody spectrum is approximately BLA.  For water at this wavelength, $\alpha$ is approximately HUGE, so $\delta$ is VERY SMALL.
