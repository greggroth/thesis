% What level of temperature resolution is needed?
% What temperature resolution is available?
% How can we improve current detectors? (SP)


Since its invention in the 1950's~\citep{carr1954} and later development in the 1970's~\citep{lauterbur1973}, {M}agnetic {R}esonance {I}maging ({MRI}) has allowed physicians and scientists a detailed view within the human body.

    \caption[Generation of the fMRI BOLD response and a corresponding temperature change]{\label{fig:flowchart} Generation of the fMRI BOLD response from changes in neuronal activity.  Black arrows indicate a causal relationship while colored dashed-arrows indicate existing models for the relationship.  The orange line ($\color{goldfish}\bullet$) shows the model proposed by~\citet{sotero2011} to calculate cerebral blood flow and metabolism and the blue line ($\color{aoi}\bullet$) shows how the model proposed by~\citet{collins} is used to calculate temperature.}

  % Start with Buxton and Friston and build up to how I am calculating the metabolism and blood flow.
