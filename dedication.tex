    \textbf{Dedication}
  \end{center}
This is dedicated to my parents who made me go to college and to Brooke who inspired me to go to graduate school.  If I wasn't lucky enough to have all of you I would probably be working for Geek Squad.
  
I also want to more specifically dedicate this to my mama.  I miss you and I think about you every day.
